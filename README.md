## Lab 01 - Beginning React JS

### Reflections

1. What went well, that I might forget if I don’t write down?
  First and foremost, the main thing that went well today was being able to get my app to render on the browser. This was an extremely hard day, mainly due to the SSH key that was being a nuisance.
2. What did I learn today?
  SSH keys. Although the error of the SSH key was fairly easy to fix, it was actually going through the entire process of figuring out what the issue was.
3. What should I do differently next time?
  I don't believe I would've done anything differently! I asked for assistance when I needed it, and certainly learned a lot about SSH keys!
4. What still puzzles me, or what do I need to learn more about?
  I still have a few issues with understanding the terminal and why the npm start is so specific with error correction (spaces, etc).
5. Is the assignment complete? If not, where exactly did you leave off, and what work remains?
  I was pleasantly surprised that I was able to get it finished today! Although it may not look that great, with a little CSS via bootstrap, I think I will be able to create a beautiful React app!

## Lab 02 React State and Props

Number and name of feature: state-and-props

Estimate of time needed to complete: 3-4 hours

Start time: 6:45pm

Finish time: 10:00pm

Actual time needed to complete: 3 1/2 hours

### Reflections

1. A question within the context of today’s lab assignment
 Is there a particular reason why I need to add alts to my img tags? I was stuck on being able to render my page on netlify unless I provided alts to two of my img tags.
2. An observation about the lab assignment, or related ‘Ah-hah!’ moment
  Implementing the alts to the img tags in order for my page to render on netlify. By researching the answer on netlify's forum, I was able to do the CI= npm run build and figuring out what the issue was.
3. How long you spent working on this assignment
With all the fun CSS and implementation of state and Props, I would say it took me roughly 4 hours to complete this assignment.
